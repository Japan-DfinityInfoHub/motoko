# ExperimentalStableMemory
Byte-level access to (virtual) _stable memory_.

**WARNING**: As its name suggests, this library is **experimental**, subject to change
and may be replaced by safer alternatives in later versions of Motoko.
Use at your own risk and discretion.

This is a lightweight abstraction over IC _stable memory_ and supports persisting
raw binary data across Motoko upgrades.
Use of this module is fully compatible with Motoko's use of
_stable variables_, whose persistence mechanism also uses (real) IC stable memory internally, but does not interfere with this API.

Memory is allocated, using `grow(pages)`, sequentially and on demand, in units of 64KiB pages, starting with 0 allocated pages.
New pages are zero initialized.
Growth is capped by a soft limit on page count controlled by compile-time flag
`--max-stable-pages <n>` (the default is 65536, or 4GiB).

Each `load` operation loads from byte address `offset` in little-endian
format using the natural bit-width of the type in question.
The operation traps if attempting to read beyond the current stable memory size.

Each `store` operation stores to byte address `offset` in little-endian format using the natural bit-width of the type in question.
The operation traps if attempting to write beyond the current stable memory size.

Text values can be handled by using `Text.decodeUtf8` and `Text.encodeUtf8`, in conjunction with `loadBlob` and `storeBlob`.

The current page allocation and page contents is preserved across upgrades.

NB: The IC's actual stable memory size (`ic0.stable_size`) may exceed the
page size reported by Motoko function `size()`.
This (and the cap on growth) are to accommodate Motoko's stable variables.
Applications that plan to use Motoko stable variables sparingly or not at all can
increase `--max-stable-pages` as desired, approaching the IC maximum (currently 8GiB).
All applications should reserve at least one page for stable variable data, even when no stable variables are used.

## Value `size`
``` motoko no-repl
let size : () -> (pages : Nat64)
```

Current size of the stable memory, in pages.
Each page is 64KiB (65536 bytes).
Initially `0`.
Preserved across upgrades, together with contents of allocated
stable memory.

## Value `grow`
``` motoko no-repl
let grow : (new_pages : Nat64) -> (oldpages : Nat64)
```

Grow current `size` of stable memory by `pagecount` pages.
Each page is 64KiB (65536 bytes).
Returns previous `size` when able to grow.
Returns `0xFFFF_FFFF_FFFF_FFFF` if remaining pages insufficient.
Every new page is zero-initialized, containing byte 0 at every offset.
Function `grow` is capped by a soft limit on `size` controlled by compile-time flag
 `--max-stable-pages <n>` (the default is 65536, or 4GiB).

## Value `stableVarQuery`
``` motoko no-repl
let stableVarQuery : () -> (shared query () -> async { size : Nat64 })
```

Returns a query that, when called, returns the number of bytes of (real) IC stable memory that would be
occupied by persisting its current stable variables before an upgrade.
This function may be used to monitor or limit real stable memory usage.
The query computes the estimate by running the first half of an upgrade, including any `preupgrade` system method.
Like any other query, its state changes are discarded so no actual upgrade (or other state change) takes place.
The query can only be called by the enclosing actor and will trap for other callers.

## Value `loadNat32`
``` motoko no-repl
let loadNat32 : (offset : Nat64) -> Nat32

## Value `loadBlob`
``` motoko no-repl
let loadBlob : (offset : Nat64, size : Nat) -> Blob
```

Load `size` bytes starting from `offset` as a `Blob`.
Traps on out-of-bounds access.

## Value `storeBlob`
``` motoko no-repl
let storeBlob : (offset : Nat64, value : Blob) -> ()
```

Write bytes of `blob` beginning at `offset`.
Traps on out-of-bounds access.
