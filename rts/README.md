The Motoko RTS (C parts)
=============================

This directory contains the parts of the Motoko runtime implemented in C.

tl;dr
-----

If you just want to get `mo-rts.wasm` in this directory, run

    nix-shell --run 'make -C rts'

from the top-level directory of the Motoko repository.

Compilation
-----------

Running `make` should produce `mo-rts.wasm`.

If run within `nix-shell`, the environment variables `WASM_CLANG` and `WASM_LD`
should point to suitable binaries (we track a specific unreleased version of
`llvm`). If not present, the `Makefile` will try to use `clang-9` and
`wasm-ld-9`.

The runtime compiles and links in [libtommath]. It needs the source, so
`nix-build` and `nix-shell` will set the environment variable `TOMMATHSRC` to
point to the source in `/nix/store`.
If not present, the `Makefile` will look in `../../libtommath`, i.e. parallel to the 
`motoko` repository; this is useful if you need to hack on libtommath.

Exporting and importing functions
---------------------------------

To export a function from C to Motoko, use the `export` annotation. This
will make the function be visible in the final shared library.

To import a function, use the `from_rts` annotation, e.g. `alloc_bytes`.


libtommath and memory managment
-------------------------------

We have to make libtommathâ€™s memory management (which expects C-like functions
`alloc`, `calloc` and `realloc`) work with the Motoko runtime. See the
comment next to `mp_alloc` in `rts.c` for the techical details.

C tests
-------

To narrow down issues, or do regression testing on the C level, you can interact
with the code provided by `rts.c` from `test_rts.c`. With

    make test_rts && ./test_rts

this is executed. This is compiled natively, so may not uncover bugs that are tied to
WebAssembly.

AFL tests
---------

Some tests are best run by AFL (American Fuzzy Lop), which is a whitebox
fuzzer that instruments the code to get more coverage.

You can install `afl` using `nix-env -i afl`.

You need to compile the code with instrumentation and then run it using the
helper script provided:

```
make clean
CLANG=afl-gcc make test_leb128
./run-afl-leb128.sh
```
